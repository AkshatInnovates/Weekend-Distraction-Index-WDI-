# 📊 Weekend Distraction Index (WDI) – Data Science Project

This project explores how weekend events and external factors (like weather, festivals, movie releases, and cricket matches) influence Monday productivity, using a custom metric called **BuzzScore**.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Analyze how weekend distractions affect productivity at the start of the workweek.
- **Data Sources:** Combined datasets from weather, movie releases, cricket match schedules, festivals, and trending searches.
- **Key Metric:** Engineered a `BuzzScore` to quantify weekend activity and compared it with productivity patterns.
- **Tooling:** Used Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI, Jupyter Notebook, and Excel.

## 💡 Highlights

- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a 3-month dataset.
- Discovered a noticeable inverse relationship between high BuzzScore weekends and Monday productivity.
- Created an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers, tooltips, and drill-throughs for deeper insights.
- Delivered a comprehensive final report with visualizations, methods, and real-world implications for businesses.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
